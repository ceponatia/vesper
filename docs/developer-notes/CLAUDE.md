# developer-notes folder instructions

This folder contains plan and spec files for development phases. Whenever possible, keep these documents up-to-date. When we develop something that conflicts with planned work, please update the planned work to reflect what has changed.
If a complete reanalysis and rewrite of the planned work is needed due to other changes in code, say so in the relevant document. Do not do this analysis unless asked to, but tell the user in your response that it is needed.

## App Development State

Vesper is a fork of Reverie, a role playing game. Vesper is more romance focused while Reverie is general.
Vesper began with a "World Model" system which had characters, locations, items, etc. and attempted to use map locations and schedules to have NPCs move around the world. This system became somewhat _broken_ and we weren't able to get characters to move to locations in a timely fashion to keep the story going, which broke the narrative aspect of the game.
Because of this, we stepped back and created a 1-on-1 character chat which was initially run from within Character forms in the library. This worked quite well and after further development, we broke it out into its own flow and added multiple character chats to it. It lacks some features the World Model had such as locations-as-entitites and map navigation, but narratively it is greatly expanded over the World Model.
We have begun deprecating the World Model system. It still exists on the page and its code is intact, but all testing and development is focused on character chat at this point.
Once character chat is sufficiently advanced we may migrate its functionality to the World Model or create an entirely new World Model system based on character chat.
